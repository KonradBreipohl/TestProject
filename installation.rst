Installation Guide
==================

Requirements
------------

Most of the dependencies will be installed with the pip package.
You will however still need an installation of swig and r-base as well as a recent version of java.
Swig and r-base are required for the Smac and Irace autoconfiguration tools and java is needed for the enhsp engine.
It is highly recommended to use linux.

You can install our project via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/DimitriWeiss/up-ac.git

Planning Engines
----------------

If one or more of the planning engines that are integrated in this algorithm configuration 
extension is not available on your system, you can install it via:
.. code-block:: bash
    pip install --pre unified-planning[<engine_name>]

Currently these planning engines are integrated and confirmed to be working:

 - lpg
 - fast-downward
 - enhsp
 - tamer
 - pyperplan

due to the unified-planning framework still being in development.

It is possible to adjust the configuration space of each engine according to your needs by passing it to the set_scenario() function. 
Read (https://automl.github.io/ConfigSpace/main/) for details on how to define a ConfigSpace.
